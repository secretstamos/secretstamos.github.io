            <h2>What is the project?</h2>
                <p>
                    Space Station 13 is a long standing multiplayer game from 2001 involving a large group of players
                    crewing a space station and facing peculiar threats and eccentric situations. It is a large community
                    split among several different iterations. Currently, Colonial Marines is the largest one of these iterations,
                    averaging several hundred players every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Colonial Marines differs from a typical branch of Space Station 13 significantly. The focus is no longer on
                    civilian roles on a space station, and instead focuses on the efforts of a military group and their investigation
                    of an abandoned planet. Working partly as a simulation and as a game, players are organized in accordance to military
                    structures, and follow a rigid chain of command- infantry are divided into individual squads, and each member of the squad
                    fulfills a specific role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge encountered by the players is organization and logistics. Good communication is required by the players
                    running the supply lines and command structure to ensure the team is functioning at peak performance. The inclusion of aircraft
                    (which can be utilized to transport players or launch airstrikes), mortars (which require spotters and coordinates) and tanks
                    (which need heavily resupply and engineering support) further complicates the organizational requirements of the team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Opposing the human faction is a team of alien monsters who have taken over the planet under investigation. This opposing force adds
                    a degree of asymmetrical gameplay, as the alien team focuses heavily on melee attacks, traps, and defenses. It does not suffer the same
                    logistical problems as the human team (such as reliance on limited supplies, tools and equipment), but experience strengths and weaknesses
                    of their own. On average, they are individually stronger, more durable, and faster than the average human soldier (and vastly moreso than
                    human support staff), but they are highly specialized. The "Crusher" class, for example, acts as a power battering ram but is vulnerable to
                    attacks from behind and is easily overwhelmed if fighting without support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game itself lends itself heavily to player interactions. Although each match (which typically lasts 2-3 hours) is self contained, many
                    players spend the time interacting with one another in off moments and building reputations together. This has led to a very tight knit community
                    of players, and is a source of much of the social interactions in the game.

            <h2>What I did</h2>
            <p>
                I joined this project in the Fall of 2014, back when it was in early development. I was the first artist of the project,
                and have since been promoted to the lead artist.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've led several major implementations and overhauls while a member of this time, and have participated in creating both art assets and code implementation.
