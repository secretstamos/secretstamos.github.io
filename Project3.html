            <h2>What is the project?</h2>
                <p>
                    Hikari Hook is a 3D VR game utilizing both the Razor Hydra and the Occulus Rift. It is a story-based game involving a character exploring an ancient forest armed with a grapple hook.
                    The plot is delivered through audio logs located on different platforms in the forest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hikari Hook was made at Osaka University in the Fall of 2015 as part of a student-collaboration project.

            <h2>What I did</h2>
            <p>
                I was the artist for Hikari Hook, and made all of the art assets, texture assets and animations myself.
                As the only artist in the group of 5 members, I was expected to generate all assets by myself.
                
                In addition to handling the graphics creation, texture creation and image mapping, I also handled
                some code for visual and particle effects. I did so with Javascript, and also wrote the transcript
                for the game's story, setting and dialogue.
                
                Lastly, I was tasked with making sure the game operated at a comfortable framerate.
